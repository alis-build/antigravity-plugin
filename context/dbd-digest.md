# Alis Build — DBD refresher

Define, Build, Deploy. Protobuf contracts live in the org's define repo
(`~/alis.build/<org>/define`); Define pins the contract to a pushed commit and generates
language packages plus platform artifacts (Spanner protobundles, Pub/Sub topics). Go
services (neurons) live in product build repos (`~/alis.build/<org>/build/<product>`);
Build runs from the latest *pushed* commit — commit and push before building. Deploy
provisions the runtime (Cloud Run plus supporting resources) from the neuron's Terraform
under `infra/`; validate via the generated playground.

## Execute through the `alis` CLI

`alis define <pkg> --json --install` · `alis build <pkg> --json --deploy -e <env>` ·
`alis deploy <pkg> --json` · `alis packages install|upgrade|add <pkg> --json`. The CLI is
self-documenting: `alis docs` and `alis <cmd> --help` are the source of truth. Under
`--json`, stdout is ONE final JSON object; progress is NDJSON on stderr — never merge
`2>&1` into a JSON parser. Never poll with `sleep` loops: block with
`alis operations wait <op> --json`. Never hand-edit dependency pins (`sed` on go.mod) or
hand-roll package-manager environments — `alis packages` handles the private registries
and credentials for you. The working directory is the context — after `alis service new`,
use `alis --cwd /absolute/buildFolder ...` before continuing. When a conversation
references an Ideate project (`ideas/<id>`), run `alis ideate context <id>` first.

## Skills are native

The `alis-discover` skill routes platform-shaped work to registry skills — quietly and
local-first: probe `alis skills suggest "<outcome>" --json`; load only on a distinctive
match (`distinctive` ≥ 3); no match means no skill and no narration. Generic coding
(Makefiles, ordinary bugs, tests, git) needs no discovery even inside a workspace. A loaded
skill owns execution. After solving something new by hand, the user can say "capture this
as a skill" and `alis-capture` saves it for their team.

Production changes require explicit approval of the exact version or pushed commit,
target environments and branch override. Present the CLI's pinned retry for approval,
then execute it with `--confirm-production` and verify its operation. Keep approved
arguments unchanged. Session modes, `--approve` and broad task intent grant no consent.

Run one standalone Alis command per shell-tool call: no pipes, output trimming or redirects.
Use `environment list <org>.<product> --json` for target IDs and production flags,
without variable values. Check CLI help when using a newly introduced command.
Start long DBD work with `--async`; retain `name` and run `next`. Start/wait/describe
use common top-level fields (`schemaVersion: 1`, `done`, `status`, `version`); legacy
start `metadata` is different from typed wait output. Read full JSON and errors.
Local agent background-task IDs are separate from Alis operation names; stopping a local
wait never cancels server work. Use logs and build cancellation with a matching
CLI/backend release. Diagnose auth, package DNS and platform failures separately.
Direct DBD commands on a known target need no skill discovery. After a plugin update,
restart the agent; `alis doctor --json` reports cache and recent hook observations.
